# Generating views

Create a simple yaml file with an array of the views you want to generate. The views will be generated in .coverage until we integrate the Looker API.

```yaml
views:
  - name: "View Name"
    reference: "Full Qualified Reference"
    primary_key: "primary_key (OPTIONAL)"
  - name: "View Name"
    reference: "Full Qualified Reference"
```
